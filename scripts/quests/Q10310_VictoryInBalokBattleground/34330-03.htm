<html><body>Grand Magister Kreia:<br>
You can get <font color="LEVEL">personal points </font>for killing monsters on the Balok Battleground.<br>
The one who <font color="LEVEL">delivered the final blow to the monster</font> receives personal point. When you obtain <font color="LEVEL">1000 points</font> or more, the Ivory Tower grants you a <font color="LEVEL">reward for participating in the Battle against Balok</font>.<br>
Each adventurer <font color="LEVEL">personal points make a sum of total points</font>. When the amount of total points reaches a certain limit <font color="LEVEL">intermediate bosses will appear</font>.<br>
There are 5 Types of <font color="LEVEL">intermediate bosses, the order, according to witch they are killed, affects the type of Balok that appears later</font>.<br>
Sometimes <font color="LEVEL">Lord Balok</font> appears instead of intermediate bosses.<br>
Now go to the Balok Battleground and stop his minions. And I will concentrate and imbue the Magic Circle with magic.
