<html><body>Letter From the Ivory Tower:<br>
Have you heard about<font color="LEVEL"> Balok</font>, a demon created by Beleth? This fiend makes a battlefield from the Gludio's Wasteland.<br>
To stop Baloks invasion, we, wizards of the Ivory Tower, have erected the Magic Circle. However, when it is being imbuted with magic <font color="LEVEL">from Monday to Saturday, from 20:30 till 21:30,</font> its power weakens and <font color="LEVEL">the Balok Battleground</font> is open.<br>
We are looking for adventurers who will be able to keep Balok at bay while the Magic Circle is recharging.<br>
You can <font color="LEVEL">teleport</font> to <font color="LEVEL">the Balok Battleground</font> from <font color="LEVEL">the corresponding UI </font>or through <font color="LEVEL">the Entrance to Balok Battleground in the Gludio region of the teleport list</font>.<br>
Upon entering the Balok Battleground, find Grand Magister Kreia. She will tell you more.<br>
