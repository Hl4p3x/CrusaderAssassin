<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
This place is called <font color="LEVEL">the Training Zone</font>.<br>
It is managed by grown. He is former mercenary who took part in many important events in Aden.<br>
I know him quite well. After retiring. he led a peaceful life and then was offered a place of the Training Zone manager.<br>
At first he grumbled about now wanting to work again but being unable to reject such an offer. But he certainly has a knack for that.<br>
Recently Grown has come to me asking to inform him about any promising adventures.<br>
And your name has been the first to come to my mind.<br>
