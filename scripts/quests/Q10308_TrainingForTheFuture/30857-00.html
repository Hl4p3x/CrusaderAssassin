<html><body>High Priest Orven:<br>
Dark times have come... Lands where you could once walk safely have become dangerous. Only skilled warriors can go there and not fear for their lives.<br>
Your enthusiasm does you credit, but you must also think about your own safety. Come back to me when you get more experience.<br>
(Available to characters of Lv. 76+.)
