<html><body>Dream Dungeon Manager Dream Priestess:<br>
There are several Dreamlands, but you never know beforehand to which one you are going to be teleported.<br>
So it's useless to plan an attack on a certain boss monster.<br>
Although if you go to the Dream Dungueon and kill a boss living there - no matter which one - your deed will bring balance to that Dreamland.<br>
Remember their names: <font color="LEVEL">Gustav, Gustav Steward, Gabrielle, Gabrielle Minion, Ventus, Rekario, Tiat Baint.</font>
Please kill any one of them.<br>
