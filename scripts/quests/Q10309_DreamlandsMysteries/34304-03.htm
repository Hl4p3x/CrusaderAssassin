It's very important to take power from them<br>
Not all Dreamland habitants are harmless, there are many fierce monster as well. Some of the monster are so strong that they brought big areas of Dreamland under their control.<br>
We cannont defeat them using our own resources. And we don not know how much damage they can do if we let them reach the real world.<br>
When we are in the dream world, our powers are different from those we've got in the real world.<br>
That's why we have to weaken Dreamland monster while they are still there.<br>
