Removing patterns is pretty easy, too! If you already have a pattern, the "Make Pattern" button will read <font color="LEVEL">Delete pattern</font>.<br>
Click the "Delete pattern" button, <font color="LEVEL">check the info about the dyes and patterns</font> and then click the <font color="LEVEL">Extract</font> icon.<br>
That's it! Do you understand how to apply and remove the patterns now?<br>
Tell me when you are ready to move on.<br>
I'll tell you about the effects of the patterns and the Hidden Power.
