After you've applied a <font color="LEVEL">pattern you will be granted a dye effect</font>. Your <font color="LEVEL">Hidden Power</font> will also <font color="LEVEL">receive an effect based on the upgrade you've picked</font>. The <font color="LEVEL">available level of Hidden Power</font> depends on the<font color="LEVEL">level of the dye</font> that was used to apply the pattern.<br>
If you want to upgrade your Hidden Power, try to level up your pattern using the <font color="LEVEL">Improve pattern</font> option in the "Patterns and Hidden Power" menu.<br>
That is all you need to know about dyes, patterns and Hidden Power. I hope it's all clear.<br>
