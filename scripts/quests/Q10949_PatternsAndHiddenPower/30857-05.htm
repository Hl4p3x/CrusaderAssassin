Great! You deserve a reward!<br>
Here's <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Dye</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Dye Powder</font>. The dye itself doesn't grant you Hidden Power, but if you use it to apply a <font color="LEVEL">pattern</font> and then <font color="LEVEL">upgrade</font> it with <font color="LEVEL">Adventurer's Dye Powder</font>, <font color="LEVEL">your Hidden Power will reach level 3</font>.<br>
There's a limit on how many times you can upgrade your Hidden Power every day, so keep that in mind.<br>
I hope I was able to help you.
